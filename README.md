5. The development server will run on port 4000
6. Next navigate to the frontend project directory: `cd convertium-nature-microsite/frontend`
7. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
8. Start the development server to run frontend: `npm start`

## Run Tests

1. Navigate to the frontend project directory: `cd convertium-nature-microsite/frontend`
2. To run tests in frontend application: `npm test`

## Features

1. **Interaction Design**: Experience completely fluid responsive site with different user interactions such as hover effects, text animations, scroll animations, twinkling stars background animation effect and interactive elements to engage users and enhance their experience.
2. **Animation**: Smooth and visually appealing animations considering animating elements on page load, transitions between sections, and interactive elements.
3. **Performance**: Optimize the microsite's performance by minimizing file sizes, reducing HTTP requests, and lazy loading images, bundle and minify assets.
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure the microsite is accessible to all users by following WCAG guidelines. Use semantic HTML, provide alternative text for images, and ensure proper color contrast for text and background elements.
5. **SEO**: Improve the microsite's search engine visibility by optimizing meta tags, using descriptive headings, and providing relevant content, implementing structured data markup to enhance search engine results.
6. **Best Practices**: Follow coding best practices to achieve good scores in Lighthouse and Google's PageSpeed Insights. This includes using optimized images(tinyPNG), minifying CSS and JavaScript, enabling caching, and implementing responsive design principles.
7. **Next.js**: Utilize Next.js for server-side rendering to improve SEO and provide a better user experience instead of React.JS alone.
8. **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript to maintain type safety and improve code quality and maintainability.
9. **SCSS**: Use SCSS to maintain frontend styles and adhere to better naming conventions using BEM.
10. **Theme**: Use of SCSS variables and mixins to create fully customizable theme to reduce development effort on tidious theming tasks.
11. **CDN**: Use of CDN assests like Google fonts to improve faster page loads.
12. **Framer Motion**: Utilize Framer Motion, a powerful animation library, to create stunning frontend animations.
13. **Swiper Slider**: Use Swiper Slider to achieve advanced requirements for the carousel component.
14. **SVG Images**: Optimize file size and improve loading speed by using SVG images.
15. **Automated Testing**: Execute automated tests using Jest to ensure the reliability of frontend components as project progresses.

## Tasks completed

- ✔️ Use one of any modern JavaScript frameworks and its libraries that runs on Node.js environment is a must.
- ✔️ Adding TypeScript and/or any web framework is a plus.
- ✔️ To be fluid responsive, full screen layout, and without scrollbar.
- ✔️ All interactions and animations (including the button and link’s hover state) should be smooth and not overdone.
- ✔️ The slide transition should fade-out and fade-in (upon clicking the navigation and on mouse-scrolling the page as well).
- ✔️ All the content of the page (the text, video, and images) must be API-consumed from JSON data (either it’s inside the code or as an external file).
- ✔️ We are looking for creativity and aesthetic on your microsite, hence do propose any kind of solutions to make it look great in terms of interaction design and animation.
- ✔️ Do keep in mind of the performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices (to achieve good scores in Lighthouse and Google’s PageSpeed Insights).
- ✔️ Share your source code with us after you have done the development.
- ✔️ A full-screen HTML5 video (set to be looping & mute) as background with semi-transparent background overlay.
- ✔️ You may use this video: http://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4
- ✔️ The text & slide indicators on the right side should be horizontally & vertically center-aligned.
- ✔️ The text should be animated.
- ✔️ The slide indicators on the right side should be treated as slide navigation.
- ✔️ The arrow at the bottom should be linked to 2nd slide (the 1st slide fade-out, the 2nd slide fade-in).
- ✔️ Propose any kind of background animations. (Twinkling stars effect)
- ✔️ You may use this set of background images:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xFtP5rLA_DNMfx9kWWmMrGVHQf8LAGsL
- ✔️ For large & medium screen: Please use: img-1920x1200.jpg & img-1280x800.jpg. The image should be in perfect full screen.
- ✔️ For medium screen, portrait mode: Please use: img-800x368.jpg
- ✔️ For small screen: Please use: img-800x368.jpg
- ✔️ “DISCOVER MORE” link should be only appeared on 2nd slide.
- ✔️ There is a responsive carousel with 5 items as well.

## Suggestion

1. It would be better if the navigation buttons were dots instead of squares. Dots are more suitable for mobile devices, allowing for easier fingertip clicks. The square shape is not as effective in this context.
